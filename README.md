# Spotify-Downloader

- Downloads songs fromÂ YouTube in an MP3 format by using Spotify's HTTP link.

- Can also download a song by entering its artist and song name (in case if you don't have the Spotify's HTTP link for some song).

- Automatically fixes song's meta-tags which include:

  - Title
  - Artist
  - Album
  - Album art
  - Album artist
  - Genre
  - Track number
  - Disc number
  - Release date
  - And some more...

- Works straight out of the box and does not require to generate or mess with your API keys.

That's how your Music library will look like!

## Reporting Issues

- Search for your problem in the [issues section](https://github.com/Ritiek/spotify-downloader/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=) before opening a new ticket. It might be already answered and save us time. :smile:

- Provide as much information possible when opening your ticket.

## Installation & Usage

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Dg8p9up.png" width="600">

- **This tool supports only Python 3**, Python 2 compatibility was dropped because of the way it deals with unicode. If you need to use Python 2 though, check out the (old) `python2` branch.

- Note: `play` and `lyrics` commands have been deprecated in the current brach since they were not of much use and created unnecessary clutter. You can still get them back by using `old` branch though.

### Debian, Ubuntu, Linux & Mac

```
cd
git clone https://github.com/ritiek/spotify-downloader
cd spotify-downloader
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```

**Important:** if you have installed both Python 2 and 3, the `pip` command could invoke an installation for Python 2. To see which Python version `pip` refers to, try `pip -V`. If it turns out `pip` is your Python 2 pip, try `pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt` instead.

You'll also need to install FFmpeg for conversion (use `--avconv` if you'd like to use that instead):

Linux: `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`

Mac: `brew install ffmpeg --with-libmp3lame --with-libass --with-opus --with-fdk-aac`

If it does not install correctly, you may have to build it from source. For more info see https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide.

### Windows

Assuming you have Python 3 ([preferably v3.6 or above to stay away from Unicode errors](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30539882/whats-the-deal-with-python-3-4-unicode-different-languages-and-windows)) already installed and in PATH.

- Download and extract the [zip file](https://github.com/ritiek/spotify-downloader/archive/master.zip) from master branch.

- Download FFmpeg for Windows from [here](http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/). Copy `ffmpeg.exe` from `ffmpeg-xxx-winxx-static\bin\ffmpeg.exe` to PATH (usually C:\Windows\System32\) or just place it in the root directory extracted from the above step.

- Open `cmd` and type `pip install -U -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies. The same note about `pip` as for Debian, Ubuntu, Linux & Mac applies.

## Instructions for Downloading Songs


**Important:** as like with `pip`, there might be no `python3` command. This is most likely the case when you have only Python 3 but not 2 installed. In this case try the `python` command instead of `python3`, but make sure `python -V` gives you a `Python 3.x.x`!

- For all available options, run `python3 spotdl.py --help`.

```
usage: spotdl.py [-h] (-s SONG | -l LIST | -p PLAYLIST | -u USERNAME) [-m]

#### Download by Name

For example

- We want to download Hello by Adele, simply run `python3 spotdl.py --song "adele hello"`.

- The script will automatically look for the best matching song and download it in the folder `Music/` placed in the root directory of the code base.

- It will now convert the song to an mp3 and try to fix meta-tags and album-art by looking up on Spotify.

#### Download by Spotify Link (Recommended)

For example

- We want to download the same song (i.e: Hello by Adele) but using Spotify Link this time that looks like  `http://open.spotify.com/track/1MDoll6jK4rrk2BcFRP5i7`, you can copy it from your Spotify desktop or mobile app by right clicking or long tap on the song and copy HTTP link.

- Run `python3 spotdl.py --song http://open.spotify.com/track/1MDoll6jK4rrk2BcFRP5i7`, it should download Hello by Adele.

- Just like before, it will again convert the song to an mp3 but since we used a Spotify HTTP link, the script is guaranteed to fetch the correct meta-tags and album-art.

#### Download multiple songs at once

For example

- We want to download `Hello by Adele`, `The Nights by Avicci` and `21 Guns by Green Day` just using a single command.

Let's suppose, we have the Spotify link for only `Hello by Adele` and `21 Guns by Green Day`.

No problem!

- Just make a `list.txt` in the same folder as the script and add all the songs you want to download, in our case it is

(if you are on Windows, just edit `list.txt` - i.e `C:\Python36\spotify-downloader-master\list.txt`)

```
https://open.spotify.com/track/1MDoll6jK4rrk2BcFRP5i7
the nights avicci
http://open.spotify.com/track/64yrDBpcdwEdNY9loyEGbX
```

- Now pass `--list=list.txt` to the script, i.e `python3 spotdl.py --list=list.txt` and it will start downloading songs mentioned in `list.txt`.

- You can stop downloading songs by hitting `ctrl+c`, the script will automatically resume from the song where you stopped it the next time you want to download the songs present in `list.txt`.

- Songs that are already downloaded will be skipped and not be downloaded again.

#### Download playlists

- You can copy the Spotify URL of the playlist and pass it in `--playlist` option.

For example

- `python3 spotdl.py --playlist https://open.spotify.com/user/camillazi/playlist/71MXqcSOKCxsLNtRvONkhF`

- The script will load all the tracks from the playlist into `<playlist_name>.txt`

- Then you can simply run `python3 spotdl.py --list=<playlist_name>.txt` to download all the tracks.

#### Download albums

- You can copy the Spotify URL of the album and pass it in `--album` option.

For example

- `python3 spotdl.py --album https://open.spotify.com/album/7CjakTZxwIF8oixONe6Bpb`

- The script will load all the tracks from the album into `<album_name>.txt`

- Then you can simply run `python3 spotdl.py --list=<album_name>.txt` to download all the tracks.

#### Download playlists by username

- You can also load songs using Spotify username if you don't have the playlist URL. (Open profile in Spotify, click on the three little dots below name, "Share", "Copy to clipboard", paste last numbers into command-line: `https://open.spotify.com/user/0123456790`)

- Try running `python3 spotdl.py -u <your_username>`, it will show all your public playlists.

- Once you select the one you want to download, the script will load all the tracks from the playlist into `<playlist_name>.txt`.

- Run `python3 spotdl.py --list=<playlist_name>.txt` to download all the tracks.

#### Specify the target directory

If you don't want to download all the songs to the `Music/` folder relative to the `spotdl.py` script, you can use the `-f`/`--folder` option. E.g. `python3 spotdl.py -s "adele hello" -f "/home/user/Music/"`. This works with both relative and absolute paths.

#### Preserve spaces in file names

Beside some other characters, spaces will be replaced by underscores. There's no option to change this behavior in spotify-downloader itself, but on Unix-based operating systems you can issue the following Bash command after downloading is done:

    find . -type f -name "*.mp3" -exec bash -c 'mv "$0" "${0//_/ }"' {} \;

Just make sure your working directory is the one you have the music files in.

## Running tests

```
python3 -m pytest test
```

Obviously this requires the `pytest` module to be installed.
